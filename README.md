# Anghami web clone

## [Live Demo](https://almo7aya.github.io/anghami-web-clone/)

I was windring about how complex is Anghami's web client layout is so I decided to create a clone of it using modern *CSS* techniques.

+ CSS grid is awesome when it works with flexbox together.

+ I built it with zero dependency in mind I only used SCSS and no other HTML preprocessors.

+ No JavaScript I forced my self to only use CSS with 0 JavaScript

+ Make some alive element like the navbar it collapsable *Try it*

> I enjoyed creating this project, _I know *CSS* is fun_
